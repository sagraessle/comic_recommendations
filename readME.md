## Change Log


### Version 1.0 - January 21, 2022


#### New Features

- Gained connection between Python and Google Sheet using Replit and Google Sheets API.
- System will recommend a random title to a user through selection 'a'.
- Basic user selection system implemented.

#### Current Issues

- Selection 'b' to recommend by genre does not work properly. The system will still recommend a title randomly. 
- Selections 'c' and 'd' which require an admin login have no functionality.

#### Future Implementations

- Loop for multiple user selections, make option for user to choose when to exit.
- Enable ability to add new entries to the Google Sheet.
- Enable ability to edit existing entries in the Google Sheet.
- Recommend based on title rating in Google Sheet--higher rating more likely to be recommended.
- Implement secure login functionality for admin users.
- Polished graphic display for ease of use.
- Possibly recommend based on myanimelist.com or webtoon.com ratings, separation from personal recommendations based off of titles I have read.
